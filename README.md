IP_ID_Website

This website is designed to engage students and teens (ages 13–18) who are interested in chemistry and enjoy immersive experiences like VR escape rooms. The site serves as a companion to the chemistry game, encouraging players to visit, interact, and deepen their understanding of chemistry concepts through interactive content and challenges.
By combining educational material with game-inspired features, the website aims to make learning chemistry more fun, motivating, and accessible for young learners.


Design Process

This website was created with the goal of keeping VR chemistry game players engaged outside of the main game. The target audience is students aged 13–18 who enjoy learning chemistry in a fun, interactive way.


User Stories:

- As a student, I want to view my leaderboard ranking, so that I can track my progress compared to others.
- As a player, I want to toggle between dark and light mode, so that I can have a comfortable browsing experience.
- As a chemistry enthusiast, I want to access interactive content on the website, so that I can deepen my understanding of chemistry concepts.

Features

Existing Features
- Leaderboard Integration – allows users to see their ranking and compare scores with others, increasing engagement and motivation.
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle – enables users to switch between dark and light themes for a personalized viewing experience.

Features Left to Implement
- Interactive quizzes and challenges related to chemistry concepts.
- More VR game-related content and rewards to further engage users.


Technologies Used

HTML/CSS – for the structure and styling of the website.
JavaScript – for interactive features like leaderboard display and theme toggle.
GitHub Copilot – assisted with coding the leaderboard integration and the dark/light mode toggle functionality.


Assistive AI

GitHub Copilot – used to generate code snippets for integrating the leaderboard and implementing the dark/light mode toggle. Screenshots of generated code were referenced during development for efficiency and accuracy.


Testing

Leaderboard: Verified that scores display correctly for different users. Tested on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.
Dark/Light Mode Toggle: Checked that theme switches properly and persists across pages.
Browser & Screen Sizes: Tested the website on multiple browsers and screen sizes (desktop and tablet). Mobile responsiveness is in progress.


Known Issues:

Some elements may not scale perfectly on smaller mobile devices.
Future updates will aim to improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
